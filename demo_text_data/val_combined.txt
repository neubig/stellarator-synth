<|format:natural|>A stellarator configuration with 4.0 field periods was designed with an aspect ratio of 6.000, elongation of 0.800, rotational transform of 0.300, and triangularity of -0.100. The simulation results showed a computed aspect ratio of 5.980, maximum elongation of 0.820, edge rotational transform of 0.310, and vacuum well depth of 0.220. This configuration shows good quasi-isodynamic characteristics.<|endoftext|>
