<|format:natural|>A stellarator configuration with 3.0 field periods was designed with an aspect ratio of 4.000, elongation of 1.200, rotational transform of 0.500, and triangularity of 0.100. The simulation results showed a computed aspect ratio of 4.050, maximum elongation of 1.250, edge rotational transform of 0.520, and vacuum well depth of 0.150. This configuration exhibits excellent quasi-isodynamic properties.<|endoftext|>
